# About

> **Next**: [Installation](#installation)

Have you ever had trouble with whatsapp web in terms of multitasking? Well I did, and it was pretty annoying whenever I wanted to multitask and tile it to a smaller portion of the screen. It is not responsive at all which what compactwhatsapp tries to fix.

  <h1> Installation </h1>
  <p>Currently this only works for chromium based browsers. In order to install it, you can check out the releases and then download the zip provided there.</p>
  <p>Next step would be to enable developer mode in your browser. You can do so by going to the extensions page (its something like chrome://extensions or brave://extensions depending on your browser) and then toggle the developer mode option.</p>

Hyper CLI comes with a starter project template as well. After the installation, run
